          are really good at. Every month we move over 1 million tons of heavy
          feedstocks. Half of this is used by refineries to supplement their
          incoming crude streams, andthe other half as blendstock for bunker
          fuel.

        <p>
          Our fuel oil trading geography is extensive. We source fuel oil and
          VGO from Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Algeria, West Africa and
          take it to major trading hubs including Rotterdam, Fujairah,
          Singapore, Turkey or directly to refineries. We serve marine bunker
          markets through long term partnerships with fleet owners and bunkering
          companies. We add value by carefully selecting incoming streams, using
          our extensive terminal network to store and blend them where required,
